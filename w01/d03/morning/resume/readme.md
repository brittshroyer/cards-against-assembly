# HTML Resume

## The challenge:

Take your most recent resume, and re-write it using HTML.

Your HTML should validate using the [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/).

## Restrictions:

You may not use any of the following tags:

```
<link>
<script>
<style>
<br />
<hr />
<iframe>
<small>
<big>
<b>
<i>
<u>
<center>
<font>
<pre>
<code>
<kbd>
<img>
```

You may not use any of the following attributes:

```
style=
onclick=
onANYTHING=
color=
bgcolor=
```

...nor anything else stylistic!

#### TLDR: No styling allowed!

# Part 1

## To submit:

Put your HTML into a Gist, for which you will need to be logged in to your Github account:

https://gist.github.com

You can write the whole thing on the Gist page, or write it in a text editor and copy/paste it into Gist.

**Be sure to click "Create Public Gist".** If you click "Create Private Gist", no-one will be able to see your homework!

To view your HTML as an actual webpage, click the "Raw" button on the Gist, and then add "htmlpreview.github.io/?" to the beginning of that page's URL.

For example, to view the HTML of this Gist:

https://gist.github.com/RobertAKARobin/1cfedea875f7521b586d

...which takes me here after clicking "Raw":

https://gist.githubusercontent.com/RobertAKARobin/1cfedea875f7521b586d/raw/35fddf251f7e39615b68fee6f2ce6e72c4bab4f9/gistfile1.html

...I would go to:

htmlpreview.github.io/?https://gist.githubusercontent.com/RobertAKARobin/1cfedea875f7521b586d/raw/35fddf251f7e39615b68fee6f2ce6e72c4bab4f9/gistfile1.html
