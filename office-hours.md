# Office Hours

Office hours will be from 5:15-7:15pm two nights a week. There will be no office hours during project weeks.

- Dirk will be here on Tuesdays
- Mike will be here on Wednesdays

The format is informal: the instructors are "on duty" to help with homework or anything that you may have questions about in general from class.

You are strongly encouraged to use these times to also work with fellow students on assignments and projects!

We will book a designated room each night and will notify you on that day.
